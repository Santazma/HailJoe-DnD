  <element name="Fang of the Dhampir" type="Magic Item" source="HailJoe Items" id="ID_HAILJOE_FANG_OF_THE_DHAMPIR">
    <description>
      <p>This item appears to be a simple wooden stake with a carved silver tip. Upon closer inspection, the silver tip is actually a sharp fang, which appears to have been taken from a vampire or dhampir. The wooden stake is infused with magical energy that allows it to draw strength from the blood of the user's enemies.</p>
      <p>Effect: When the Fang of the Dhampir is used as a melee weapon, it grants the following benefits to a monk:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The user gains temporary hit points equal to their Wisdom modifier whenever they score a critical hit against a creature with blood flowing through their veins (excluding constructs and undead).</li>
        <li>The user can spend 1 ki point as a bonus action to gain advantage on their next attack roll with the Fang of the Dhampir against a creature with blood flowing through their veins (excluding constructs and undead).</li>
        <li>Once per day, the user can choose to infuse the Fang of the Dhampir with their own blood. Doing so grants the following additional benefits until the next dawn:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>The user gains resistance to necrotic damage.</li>
          <li>The user gains advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell.</li>
          <li>The user's unarmed strikes and attacks with the Fang of the Dhampir deal an additional 1d4 necrotic damage to creatures with blood flowing through their veins (excluding constructs and undead).</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>

  <element name="Sanguinary Bloodreaper" type="Magic Item" source="HailJoe Items" id="ID_HAILJOE_SANGUINARY_BLOODREAPER">
    <description>
      <p>The Bloodreaper is a longsword made of dark obsidian, almost vantablack in color. The blade is slightly curved and glimmers with a faint crimson sheen. The handle is wrapped in black leather, and the pommel is adorned with a red gemstone that seems to pulse with energy. The sword seems to sing a haunting melody when wielded in battle.</p>
      <p>Effect: When a hexblade warlock wields the Bloodreaper, they gain the following benefits:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The sword is a +3 magic weapon made of obsidian.</li>
        <li>Whenever the user lands a successful hit with the sword, they regain 1d8 + Constitution modifier hit points.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="indent"><i><b>Blood Bond:</b></i> The sword has a special ability called Blood Bond. Whenever the user successfully hits a creature with the sword, they form a blood bond with that creature. While the bond is active, the user can use their bonus action to make a melee spell attack against the creature, dealing an additional 2d6 necrotic damage. The bond lasts for 24 hours or until the creature dies. If the user becomes unconscious, the bond vanishes immediately. This bonus action melee spell attack does not count as a "successful hit with the sword," so the user can't regain hit points by using the bonus attack.</p>
      <p class="indent"><i><b>Sanguine Strike:</b></i> The sword also has an ability called Sanguine Strike. Once per short or long rest, the user can teleport up to 15 feet forward and stab the sword into the ground. After the jump, all creatures within a 15-foot radius centered on the user are pushed 5 feet away from the center point, and all creatures in this area must make a Dexterity saving throw with a DC equal to 8 + the user's proficiency bonus + the user's Charisma modifier. On a failed saving throw, they take 6d6 necrotic damage, or half as much damage on a successful one. Creatures who succeed on the saving throw are not pushed away.</p>
      <p class="indent"><i><b>Bloodletting:</b></i> The sword has a passive ability called Bloodletting. Whenever the user is struck by a melee attack, they can use their reaction to make a melee attack against the attacker with the Bloodreaper. If the attack hits, the attacker takes an extra 1d6 necrotic damage, and the user regains hit points equal to the damage dealt. The user can only use this reaction when bonded with the "Blood Bond" ability; otherwise, the user can't use this reaction.</p>

The hilt is wrapped in supple, obsidian-hued leather, and a single crimson gemstone, pulsating with arcane energy, rests in the pommel.

  <element name="Infernal Baneblade" type="Magic Item" source="HailJoe Items" id="ID_HAILJOE_INFERNAL_BANEBLADE">
    <description>
      <p>The Infernal Baneblade is a finely crafted longsword forged from the darkest of metals and adorned with intricate, ominous engravings. Its hilt is wrapped in deep crimson leather, and a sinister ruby gemstone is embedded in the pommel. The blade itself seems to flicker with an internal flame, casting eerie shadows even in the brightest light.</p>
      <p>class="indent"><i><b>Effect:</b></i> When the user attunes to the Infernal Baneblade, they gain the following benefits:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>As a melee weapon, Infernal Baneblade functions as a +2 magic longsword</li>
        <li>Infernal Baneblade is a Sentient Weapon with unknown stats. It can communicate telepathically with its wielder. It has hearing and Devil's Sight to 120 ft and he can see through the magical darkness.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>All Effects:</p>
      <p class="indent"><i><b>Infernal Fury:</b></i> The sword deals an additional 2d6 fire damage on every successful hit, against fiends. This fire damage is considered magical and bypasses any fire resistance or immunity possessed by demons.</p>
      <p class="indent"><i><b>Demonbane Enchantment:</b></i> The Infernal Baneblade has been imbued with the essence of demonic creatures during its creation. As a result, it grants its wielder advantage on all attack rolls against demons.</p>
      <p class="indent"><i><b>Demonic Resonance:</b></i> When attuned to the Infernal Baneblade, the wielder gains resistance to fire damage, taking half damage from all fire-based attacks and effects.</p>
      <p class="indent"><i><b>Hellfire Strike:</b></i> Once per long rest, the wielder can channel the sword's demonic energy to deliver a devastating Hellfire Strike. This strike envelops the blade in raging flames and allows the wielder to make a single melee attack with advantage. If the attack hits, it deals an additional 4d6 fire damage, and the target must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or be set ablaze, taking an additional 2d6 fire damage at the start of each of its turns until it takes an action to extinguish the flames.</p>
      <p class="indent"><strong><em>Curse of the Blood Hunger.</em></strong> This insidious curse, steeped in dark and ancient magic, ignites an unquenchable thirst within its unfortunate victim. From the moment it takes hold, an insatiable craving for the life essence of others consumes them. The cursed individual is driven to seek out fresh blood, be it from mortal veins or the pulsing hearts of creatures. As time goes on, the hunger grows more ravenous, slowly eroding their humanity and instilling a relentless predator's instinct. The curse distorts their thoughts, warping their once noble intentions into a primal obsession for sating their unending bloodlust. The cursed one is forever tormented by the dichotomy of their desires—a desperate longing for release from the curse's grip, while simultaneously reveling in the euphoria that accompanies the taste of warm, crimson life.</p>
      <p class="indent">When the Infernal Baneblade is equipped and attuned, with each kill that has taken by this swors wearer, "Infernal Baneblade" absorbs the blood. The user rolls for DC 16 Constitution saving throw. On failing save, causing the crystals to glow on the item, and increase the wearer's attack and damage bonus by +1 but reducing his max HP by -5, up to a 5 stacks, resetting each day. The user may willingly choose to fail this save.</p>
      <p class="indent">After a threshold of 5 is reached in one day, the sword would curse and bind itself to the wearer, making its effects permanent, but requiring a blood tax - either in the form of necrotic damage to the wearer, or forcing the character to kill a given number of creatures in required blood amount for every day. Each day, the wearer should kill at least 3 kills.</p>
      <p class="indent">For each day that user neglects the dark urge, the wearer has to make an DC 19 Constitution saving throw and take 2d6 necrotic damage or half as much in a success. Whether success or fails, the user also lose his/her max hit points equal amount to the damage recieves. The only way to gain lost hit points in this way, is feeding the relentless blood urge. The user has to feed the item with blood in sufficient amount which is 3 medium sized humanoid creatures blood. This sufficient amount stacks when the user doesn't feeds the item.</p>
      <p class="indent">If the item drains the wearers hit points to zero, it will consume their body and the sword becomes alive, a Chaotic Evil creature with equal amount the CR to the characters level or monster CR it just killed. It would echo the wearer's voice, but it would be a demonic entity that the ultimate demonic entities wishes. When the appeared demonic entity killed, the sword itself would return to being just as a sword, waiting to be used for its next victim.</p>
      <p class="indent">The person who died in this manner, can't return back from the death. Upon with his/her death, the users soul merges with the Evil creature, and when the user tried to turn back to life, Evil creature will return back instead of him/her. The users will and soul, shatters in the dark existance and will no longer be able to return...</p>
      <p class="indent">This item is impervious to magical effects and damage, even without the exception of a remove curse spell, which would normally detach the seal from its wearer and unattune from them automatically. But for this uncontrollable hunger, there is no solution except dying. Even after the dying, the users soul will be long gone. Only "Wish" spell could find a cure with an uncertain and unclear manner.</p>

      <p>When you attune to this weapon, you will learn light cantrip. If you cast the light cantrip targeting this weapon, the carved runes activate. For the duration of the spell, as long as you hold the weapon, your Wisdom score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, and you can see normally in darkness, both magical and nonmagical, to a distance of 60 feet.</p>

      <p class="indent"><i><b>Trick Weapon:</b></i> The Faux Lunaire is a wickedly curved scythe crafted from an arcane alloy and engraved with lunar imagery and celestial runes. With a swift, spinning motion, the limbs of the blade and shaft of the scythe fold in and rotate around the grip, locking into place to form an ornate shortbow. As a bonus action, you can switch between the transformed and untransformed states of this weapon. As part of the bonus action, you can also magically teleport up to 10 feet to an unoccupied space that you can see. In its untransformed state, this weapon is a scythe. In its transformed state, it’s a shortbow.</p>
      <p class="indent"><i><b>Untransformed:</b></i> Once on each of your turns when you damage a creature with this weapon, you can force it to make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, becoming affected by the faerie fire spell on a failure. You do not need to concentrate on this spell, but it ends early if you put another creature under the effect of the spell, or if you fall unconscious.</p>
      <p class="indent"><i><b>Transformed:</b></i> In its transformed state, the Faux Lunaire has 2 charges. When you attack a creature with this bow, you can expend 1 charge to cast one of the following spells (save DC 17) from it (no action required): moonbeam or darkness. The spell is centered on the creature’s space and lasts until the end of your next turn. You do not need to concentrate on it, and you can only have one of these spells active at a time. If your attack misses, you expend the charge but the effect fails. The Faux Lunaire regains 1 expended charge each time it is targeted by the light cantrip.</p>

    <description>
      <p class="flavor">These forty dark siblings, known only by the cold moniker of Spellrender, are the grim testament to the White Citadel's ceaseless campaign against the arcane arts. Forged in bitter seclusion by the shackled artisans of Wano—each blow of the hammer a coerced prayer for freedom—the steel catches the light with an unnatural, bleached luminescence. It is a sword of dread uniformity, possessing a duality that speaks volumes of its purpose: one edge is truth, honed for the swift dispatch of the corporeal, while the opposing serration is a coil of subtle, magical malice. Upon striking with this wicked reverse, the blade does not seek mere flesh; it inflicts a wound that is intrinsically resonant with the Weave, compelling the rawest essence of any subsequent spell to violently recoil upon its caster. Thus, the Spellrender ensures that the very act of defiance, the casting of a forbidden word, becomes the engine of the arcanist's own undoing.</p>
      <p>This magic weapon has the finesse property. When you equipped this weapon, you considered as proficient on Longswords. Also when you hit a creature with this weapon, you can choose to hit it with the inverted, serrated side of the blade: the damage from the attack is halved, and the target suffers a magical gash until the start of your next turn. The first time a creature begins to cast a spell while affected by the gash, the wound flares and deals 2d8 force damage to the target. Once you apply a gash, this property of the weapon can't be used again until the start of your next turn or until the target casts a spell.</p>

    <description>
      <p class="flavor">It is said that this whip was first forged in the heart of a sunken storm, where the breath of the sea met the crackle of the sky. The metal itself seems to weep with the memory of deep-water currents from the The Cobalt Abyss, always cool to the touch and unnervingly slick, yet possessing a startling kinetic grace. Tales speak of its first wielder, a Mage-Captain whose name is Royston the Parson, sought to make the very ocean his domain, and who could lash out with a coil of lightning that neither wave nor tide could smother. To hold it is to feel a restless, surging power, a silent promise that in the darkest depths, you shall still command the light.</p>
      <p>This magic whip hums with electricity. It has 4 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn. When you hit a creature with this whip, you can expend 1 or more of its charges to deal an extra 1d6 lightning damage to that creature for each charge you spend. You don't suffer the negative effects of underwater fighting when you make an attack with this weapon.</p>
	  <p>When you hit an underwater creature with this whip, it automatically takes an extra 1d6 lightning damage from the attack—as if you had expended a charge from it. When this happens, you can still spend charges from the whip to deal additional lightning damage to the creature. If you do, each other creature of your choice within 10 feet of the target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or take lightning damage equal to half the amount dealt to the target.</p>

  <element name="Timepiercer" type="Magic Item" source="HailJoe Items" id="ID_HAILJOE_TIMEPIERCER">
    <description>
      <p class="flavor">The origin of the Timepiercer is shrouded in the swirling dust storms of the Great Glass Waste, a place where the sun is said to shatter the hours into sand. It is rumored to be the final work of the reclusive chronomancers and dunamancers of the forgotten city of Aeterna, who sought not to conquer time, but to borrow brief, focused moments of it. The exquisite quartz hilt, forever holding its paradoxical hourglass, pulses with the faint echo of countless lost seconds. When its Command Word is uttered, the very essence of the dunes seems to answer, coalescing into a shimmering blade of perfectly arrested time. To wield it is to touch the hem of destiny, granting the holder the terrifying ability to either accelerate the world into a breathless blur or drag it into a grinding, heavy crawl—a power that must be treated with the solemn reverence reserved for the movements of the cosmos.</p>
      <p>This item appears to be a sword hilt that has a small hole on either end of it. The hilt is made of clear quartz and contains an hourglass with sand inside it. Despite the holes on the hilt, the sand never seems to flow out of the hourglass. You can speak the hilt's command word as a bonus action to cause it to form a thin blade made of sand at its end. The hourglass spills sand from the bottom of the hilt that circulates up and around to form the guard and blade of the rapier before it returns to the hourglass again through the hole at the top of the hilt. You can speak the hilt's command word again to cause all the sand to return to the hourglass. While the blade is formed, you gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.</p>
	  <p>While holding the hilt, you can use it to cast the haste or slow spell (save DC 16). You have advantage on Constitution saving throws you make in order to maintain concentration on a spell cast in this way. Once a spell has been cast using the hilt, it can't be used to cast that spell again until the following dawn. The sands in the hourglass move quickly while you concentrate on a haste spell cast in this way, or more slowly when you concentrate on a slow spell.</p>

    <description>
      <p class="flavor">Born from the silent, freezing expanses of the Abyssal Slip, the Greataxe of the Rift Weaver was once the sacred tool of Valerius the Unspoken, a legendary Rift Hunter who did not stand alone against the tides of the void. During the War of the Shattered Constellations, Valerius marched alongside the master-choristers of the Harmonium Guild of Melodia, their celestial anthems briefly pushing back the hollow will of The Dark One. Yet, within the Void-Scarred Nebula, the music died; the Guild was silenced in a cacophony of shadow, and Valerius was struck down as the last note of Melodia’s bravery faded into the dark. Claimed as a trophy of that grand defeat, the weapon—a masterpiece of gravity-defying chitin—was dragged into the depths by Mortarossa, who embedded the blade within her own thorax to stifle its cosmic resonance with her profane rot. For centuries, the axe hummed a mournful, rhythmic vibration against her ribs, a funeral dirge for the Guild brothers it could no longer protect. Now, freed from its fleshy prison, the axe retains its unnerving, weightless grace and a vengeful hunger; it strikes not merely at the body, but at the fabric of existence, seeking to unweave the reality of its foes with the same cold, harmonic precision that once echoed through the halls of Melodia.</p>
      <p>This weapon is forged from a single piece of incredibly dense, blackened otherworldly chitin, harvested from the fungal queen's remains. Though it retains the Greataxe shape (a heavy, two-handed, wickedly sharp blade), its weight and balance are unnaturally light, designed for precise, devastating strikes. The edge shimmers with faint, chaotic energy. You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.</p>
	  <p class="indent"><strong><em>Finesse Adaptation.</em></strong>When you attuned to this weapon, you immediately considered proficient with Greataxes. Also you can wield this weapon with the Finesse property but not with full efficiency. When you attack with it, you can use your Dexterity modifier, instead of your Strength modifier, for the attack and damage rolls. When you wield this weapon as a finesse weapon, its damage reduces to 1d8 instead of 1d12.</p>
	  <p class="indent"><strong><em>Rift Stalker's Corrupted Strike.</em></strong>When you hit a creature with this weapon, you can choose to deal an extra 1d8 Force damage. If you reduce a creature to 0 hit points with this damage, the creature is instantly disintegrated into a pile of pale spores and eldritch dust.</p>
	  <p class="indent"><strong><em>Grappler's Cosmis Bane.</em></strong>When you successfully hit a creature that is Grappled or Restrained by any effect, the extra damage increases to 2d8 Force damage. Dealing damage in this manner, also ignores resistance and immunity to Force damage.</p>
	  <p class="indent"><strong><em>Rift Hunter's Precision.</em></strong>When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for this weapon, you can choose to reroll one die once per turn. You must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or 2.</p>

      <p class="flavor">Forged not in the distant mists of myth, but under the iron-clad decree of the High Inquisition following the silent end of the Great War Among Gods, Opulence stands as a masterpiece of modern divine craftsmanship. It was fashioned to be a living cathedral of steel—a radiant testament to the unwavering glory of the Radiant One, designed to remind the world that heaven’s light is both a sanctuary and a blinding judgment. The four candles upon its golden hilt do not merely flicker; they breathe with the choir-song of a thousand zealous priests, casting a defiant, amber glow that refuses to yield to the encroaching shadows of the new age. To bear this blade is to act as the mortal herald of an eternal hearth, wielding a weapon that mirrors the sheer, overwhelming extravagance of the divine. It is a sword of gold and gravity, promising that under the watchful gaze of the High Inquisition, the darkness will not just be pushed back—it will be utterly outshone by the blinding weight of righteous prosperity.</p>
      <p>You have a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. Additionally, attacks made with this weapon deals an extra 1d8 radiant damage on a hit.</p>
      <p class="indent"><strong><em>Flickering Defiance.</em></strong> While the sword is drawn, you gain a +1 bonus to AC for each burning candle on the hilt (maximum +4). As you expend charges and the candles go out, this AC bonus decreases accordingly.</p>
      <p class="indent"><strong><em>The Eternal Quatrain.</em></strong> The hilt of the sword features four golden candleholders, each bearing a tall, magical candle. These candles represent the weapon's charges (maximum 4). They shed bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. The candles regain all expended charges daily at dawn. You can expend charges to activate the following effects:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Sear the Soul (1 Charge):</strong> When you hit a creature, you can cause a candle’s flame to flare. The target takes an extra 1d8 radiant damage and must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or be Blinded until the end of your next turn.</li>
        <li><strong>Waxed Bastion (1 Charge):</strong> As a reaction when you take damage, one candle briefly liquefies into a golden shield. You gain Resistance to all types of damage until the end of your next turn.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="indent"><strong><em>Gilded Rebirth.</em></strong> If you drop to 0 hit points but not killed outright while holding this sword, the sword's remaining sacred power explodes in a burst of divine gold. You immediately regain 40 hit points, and all hostile creatures within 15 feet must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw or take 8d6 radiant damage. Once this property is used, it cannot be used again until the next dawn.</p>

    <description>
      <p class="flavor">To the sailors of Pillivar, the sea is not merely water, but a vast, weeping grave that holds the memories of the Sunless Era. Ruinous Ink is the most terrifying of those memories—a jagged blade of 'breathing' metal that predates the first sunrise, serving as a cold, calcified proof of the Ancient Gods who once churned the deep. Aspiring captains and power-hungry privateers whisper its name in the shadowed taverns of the docks, dreaming of the day they might dredge this relic from the abyss to command the tides. Yet, the sword is no mere tool; its hilt is a writhing mass of animated chitin and ink-stained tentacles that seem to recognize a master only to slowly consume them. It does not cut with the clean edge of a smith’s labor, but with a rhythmic, alien hunger that liquefies reality itself, turning the flesh of the living into the caustic sludge of the dead. To carry the Ink is to hear the telepathic heartbeat of a Great Old One pulsing against your palm, an indifferent and crushing presence that demands a constant tribute of salt and blood. It is the ultimate prize of Pillivar, but it is a crown made of anchors; for he who wields the depths is destined to be dragged down by them, forever bound to a silent, drowning god whose name the world has mercifully forgotten.</p>
      <p>You have a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. Additionally, attacks made with this weapon deals an extra 1d10 acid damage on a hit.</p>
      <p class="indent"><strong><em>Sentience (Subtle).</em></strong> The sword carries the presence of a "Great Old One". It telepathically communicates feelings of cold hunger and ancient, alien indifference to its wielder.</p>
      <p class="indent"><strong><em>Grip of the Ancients.</em></strong> When you hit a creature, you can use a bonus action to command the tentacles to lash out. The target must succeed on a DC 18 Strength saving throw or be Grappled and Restrained by the blade. While a creature is grappled this way, you cannot attack another target with this sword, but you can deal 2d10 acid damage as a bonus action on your turns.</p>
      <p class="indent"><strong><em>Caustic Corrosion.</em></strong> Your attack rolls with this weapon score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20. If you already have a feature that increases your critical hit range, this weapon reduces the required roll by 1 again. On a critical hit, the target takes an additional 2d6 acid damage (not multiplied). Furthermore, until the end of its next turn, the creature's AC is reduced by 3 and it has disadvantage on Strength and Dexterity checks and saving throws.</p>
      <p class="indent"><strong><em>Whispers of the Sunless Sea.</em></strong> While attuned to this sword, you gain 40 feet swimming speed and you can breathe underwater. Additionally, you gain Darkvision out to 120 feet.</p>
      <p class="indent"><strong><em>The Void’s Ink (3/Long Rest).</em></strong> As an action, you spray a cloud of magical black-green ink in a 20-foot radius. The area is Heavily Obscured for everyone except you. Creatures starting their turn in the ink must make a DC 18 Constitution save or take 4d6 poison damage. This ink cloud lasts for 1 minute.</p>
      <p class="indent"><strong><em>Curse of the Depth’s Call.</em></strong> This sword is cursed. Becoming attuned to it extends the curse to you. As long as you remain cursed, for every 24 hours without the sword being submerged in salt water, you take one level of Exhaustion. This Exhaustion cannot be removed until the sword is soaked for at least 1 hour per level. You can't remove this curse by any manners. Even if the attunement ends, the curse still remains.</p>

    <description>
      <p class="flavor">The Glimmering Sting is a masterpiece of Archfey whimsy, Forged not from the crude ores of the mortal realm, but from the crystallized laughter of dryads and the frozen tears of a summer moon. It is a blade of living quartz that does not merely occupy space; it dances within it, its edge so impossibly thin that it is said to sever a man's resolve before it ever touches his skin. To the Warlocks who pledge their souls to the shimmering courts of the Feywild, this sword is the ultimate testament of their Patron’s favor—a sliver of the Seelie Throne itself, bound in silk and starlight. In the high epics of the Minas Federation, the Elven court and the whispered songs of the pixie-circles, the Sting is described as a beautiful contradiction: a weapon that smells of crushed violets and fresh rain, yet carries a psychic venom capable of trapping the mind in an eternal, blissful delusion. To wield it is to command a swirling orbit of spectral petals that defy the laws of iron and wood, allowing the bearer to step through the fabric of reality as easily as a shadow slips through the trees. It is the capricious soul of the Wilds made manifest—a gift that is as lethal as a winter frost and as breathtaking as a dream you can never quite remember.</p>
      <p>You have a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. Additionally, attacks made with this weapon deals an extra 1d8 psychic damage on a hit.</p>

      <p class="indent"><strong><em>The Stinger’s Charm.</em></strong> When you hit a creature, you can force them to make a DC 18 Charisma saving throw. On a failure, the target is Charmed by you and becomes Incapacitated for 1 minute. While charmed in this way, the creature is incapacitated as it falls into a blissful, waking dream, staring at the shifting colors within the glass blade. The effect ends early if the creature takes damage. You can't use this feature on the same person again until next dawn.</p>
      <p class="indent"><strong><em>Fey-Step Sorcery.</em></strong> The sword holds 7 charges (regains 1d4 + 3 at dawn). While holding the sword, you can use charges to cast the following spells (DC 18): Faerie Fire (1 charge), Suggestion (2 charges), Misty Step (2 charges), Hypnotic Pattern (3 charges), Greater Invisibility (4 charges), Confusion (4 charges), Mislead (5 charges).</p>

    <description>
      <p class="flavor">High upon the northern-east jagged lands of the Frost-Spire Peaks, where the air is thin enough to shatter, the Goliath tribes once labored over a blade meant to embody the stoic strength of the mountains. Forged using the deep-earth secrets of the Dwarven masters and the titanic embers of the Giants, Verglas began its life as a holy relic of the North—a protector against the prophesied wrath of the Storm Dragon. However, when the Eldritch Moon bled its violet sickness across the sky, the blade did not merely freeze; it changed. The primal ice within its steel warped under the moon’s aberrant gravity, turning from a defensive shield into a weapon of crushing, celestial weight. To the northern clans, the bearer of Verglas is a living omen, a guardian tasked with wielding the very stillness of the grave to halt the coming cataclysm. Yet, the price of such power is a brittle soul; the sword grants the wielder the heavy majesty of a dying glacier and the shimmering, haunting light of the Aurora, but it leaves their body as fragile as thin ice under a winter sun. It is a crown of absolute zero, a jagged tooth pulled from the maw of a primeval winter that waits for the world to finally fall silent.</p>
      <p>You have a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. Additionally, it deals an extra 2d6 cold damage on a hit.</p>
      <p class="indent"><strong><em>Frostbite Contact.</em></strong> A creature other than its wielder can't equip this sword. Whenever a creature other than its wielder touches the sword while not attuned for equipping to it must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or take 3d10 cold damage and have disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks and saving throws until it loses the sword.</p>
      <p class="indent"><strong><em>Glacial Resistance.</em></strong> You gain Resistance to Cold and Fire damage.</p>
      <p class="indent"><strong><em>Splinter Volley.</em></strong> As a bonus action, you can launch an orbiting shard at a creature within 30 feet. Make a ranged weapon attack. On a hit, the target takes 2d6 piercing damage and 2d6 cold damage. The shard regrows at the start of your next turn.</p>
      <p class="indent"><strong><em>Shatterpoint Gravity.</em></strong> Whenever you hit a creature with this sword, targeted creature must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or the weapon's strange frozen gravity pulls at the target's movements. The target’s speed is reduced by 15 feet, and it cannot take Reactions until the start of your next turn.</p>
      <p class="indent"><strong><em>Aurora Singularity (Proficiency Bonus/Long Rest).</em></strong> When you hit a creature, you can mark the creature with an Aurora brand. At the start of your next turn, the brand detonates. The creature and those within 10 feet must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw, taking cold damage equal to half (failure) or quarter (success) the damage dealt by the original attack. You can use this a number of times equal to your Proficiency Bonus per Long Rest.</p>
      <p class="indent"><strong><em>Borealis Pulse (1/Long Rest).</em></strong> As an action, you plunge the blade into the ground, causing a cataclysmic eruption of prime black ice. Every creature of your choice within a 60-foot radius must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, chosen creatures takes 12d6 cold damage. On a success, it takes half as much damage. This damage ignores cold resistance. Following the eruption, a massive ice storm swirls outward to a 120-foot radius centered on the point of impact. For the next 1 minute, this entire area becomes difficult terrain for all creatures except you. While within this 120-foot radius storm, you are under the effects of the <em>Freedom of Movement</em> spell for 1 minute, allowing you to glide effortlessly through the ice and snow. You can use this feature once per Long Rest.</p>
      <p class="indent"><strong><em>Curse of Gravitational Glacial Slumber.</em></strong> This sword is cursed. Becoming attuned to it extends the curse to you. As long as you remain cursed, your body becomes as fragile as ice but also the gravitational pull of the black ice makes you heavy. Your weight triples, you have Disadvantage on Stealth and Acrobatics checks, and you automatically fail any check made to swim. Additionally, while you attuned to this sword, you become Vulnerable to Thunder damage. Also, if you take more than 30 damage from a single source, you must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution save or be Stunned until the end of your next turn as your form shatters like ice.</p>
	  <p class="indent">This curse is woven into the very soul of the wielder and cannot be ended by Remove Curse or Wish spells. Even if the attunement ends, the curse still remains. To remove this curse, the wielder must seek out a master blacksmith like Efreeti Smith or a Goliath Runecarver to forge a specialized <em>Anchor of Souls</em> from iron taken from a fallen star. This anchor must be fused to the wielder’s heart. Once the anchor is cooled in the blood of a Solar, the gravitational instability is grounded, neutralizing the curse's weight and fragility.</p>

    <description>
      <p class="flavor">Within the Crimson Citadel, where the sky of the Blood Plane hangs like a fresh wound and the only light is the rhythmic pulse of an eternal vein, the first of these blades was pulled from the calcified heart of Morvath Sangrave. Osculum Mortis et Cruor is not merely a weapon; it is a parasitic key to Morvath’s own divinity—a sliver of the progenitor’s hunger granted to those who find beauty in the Inverted Sacrament. Throughout the eons, these swords have been worn by loyal generals as badges of high heresy or stolen by ambitious thieves who mistook the swords whisper for their own strength. Yet, the outcome is always a singular, red tragedy. The chains that bind the hilt to the wrist are but the first links of a spiritual tether; as the blade drinks, it slowly draws the wielder toward the Shadow of the Crimson King. No matter how many martyred souls are harvested or how much liquid currency is paid, the debt remains unpaid. Every bearer of the Kiss eventually finds themselves standing before the throne of Morvath, only to realize that the power they wielded was never theirs—it was merely lent, a fattening of the calf before the inevitable, eternal harvest.</p>
      <p>You have a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. Additionally, it deals an extra 2d6 necrotic damage on a hit.</p>
      <p class="indent"><strong><em>Plasma Veil.</em></strong> You have Resistance to Necrotic and Poison damage, and you are immune to the Charmed condition.</p>
      <p class="indent"><strong><em>Vampiric Tithe.</em></strong> When you hit a creature, you regain hit points equal to the necrotic damage dealt. Excess healing becomes Temporary Hit Points (maximum 30).</p>
      <p class="indent"><strong><em>The Inverted Sacrament.</em></strong> As a bonus action, you present the inverted crimson cross hanging from the chains as a icon of heresy to a chosen creature within 30 feet. The target must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or be Frightened for 1 minute. While frightened, it takes 2d6 necrotic damage at the start of each of its turns. It can repeat the save at the end of its turns. You can't use this on the same person again until next dawn.</p>
      <p class="indent"><strong><em>Blood Harvest.</em></strong> Whenever a Medium or larger creature with blood that you damaged dies within 1 minute, the sword gains 1 Blood Charge (Max 20). You can expend charges (DC 18) for:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Bloodthirsty Sight (2 Charges):</strong> As a bonus action, you can attune your senses to the flow of blood around you for 1 minute. During this time, you gain Blindsight out to 60 feet and you know the exact current hit points of any creature within that range that has blood.</li>
        <li><strong>Blood-Stained Speed (4 Charges):</strong> As a bonus action, you gain the effects of the Haste spell until the end of your next turn.</li>
        <li><strong>Exsanguinating Strike (6 Charges):</strong> As a bonus action, your next successful hit with the sword causes the target to bleed uncontrollably. The target takes 3d4 necrotic damage at the start of each of its turns for 1 minute. It can repeat the save at the end of its turns to end the effect.</li>
        <li><strong>Mortium Siphon (8 Charges):</strong> As an action, you choose up to 3 creatures you can see within 30 feet. They must make a Constitution saving throw or take 4d8 necrotic damage, and you heal yourself half of the damage dealt.</li>
        <li><strong>Wall of Coagulation (10 Charges):</strong> As an action, you create a 20-foot tall, 40-foot long wall of solidified, magical blood. The wall is opaque, has 100 HP and 10 AC, and any creature that touches it or starts its turn within 5 feet of it must make a Strength save or be Grappled by tendrils of blood.</li>
        <li><strong>Rain of Gore (12 Charges):</strong> As an action, you thrust the sword into the air, and the stored essence erupts into the sky before falling as a localized rain of boiling blood in a 40-foot radius centered on you. Every creature of your choice in the area must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 8d8 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.</li>
        <li><strong>Avatar of the Blood God (20 Charges):</strong> As an action, you release all stored essence. For 1 minute, you grow large bat-like wings (60ft fly speed), your reach increases by 5 feet, and you deal an additional 3d6 necrotic damage on every hit. During this time, you regain 10 HP at the start of each of your turns.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="indent"><strong><em>Crimson Mist Form (1/Day).</em></strong> Once per day, you can use an action to dissolve into the red plasma that surrounds the blade. You gain the effects of the <em>Gaseous Form</em> spell for 1 hour. While in this form, you appear as a swirling red mist, have a flying speed of 20 feet, and can pass through small holes and narrow openings.</p>
      <p class="indent"><strong><em>Curse of the Crimson King.</em></strong> This sword is cursed. Becoming attuned to it extends the curse to you. As long as you remain cursed, the blade requires fresh blood to maintain its form. If the sword does not deal damage to a living creature (excluding constructs or undead) for 24 hours, the plasma turns into a choking smoke. You take 1d12 necrotic damage every day that cannot be reduced in any way until the sword tastes blood. Your maximum hit points also reduces as necrotic damage dealt by this manner. Additionally, your reflection disappears from mirrors, and you cannot enter a residence without an invitation from one of the occupants.</p>
	  <p class="indent">This curse is woven into the very soul of the wielder and cannot be ended by Remove Curse or Wish spells. Even if the attunement ends, the curse still remains. To remove this curse, the wielder must brew a potion using the nectar of a Black Rose grown in the Abyss and the breath of a Lich. But in order to this ritual work, the wielder must find a person who is willing to truly and selflessly love them despite their monstrous nature. The wielder and the lover must then perform a ritual together where both parties bleed into a silver chalice. After that, the wielder and the lover must mix this brewed potion with their blood in silver chalice, then they need to drink this concoction together. Drinking this while holding the sword forces both the wielder and the lover into a death-like trance for 72 hours. If they survive the psychic assault of the sword's sanguine trial, they wake up with the bond broken.</p>

  <element name="Insectum Dominus" type="Magic Item" source="HailJoe Items" id="ID_HAILJOE_ITEM_INSECTUM_DOMINUS">
    <description>
      <p class="flavor">Forged from the iridescent, unbreakable chitin of the Prime Monarch and First Broodmother, Khepri-Zul, this blade is less a sword and more a sovereign decree whispered in the language of clicking mandibles and humming wings. From the moonlit glades of the Feywild’s Amber-Thicket to the lightless, fungal cathedrals of the Underdark’s Deep-Hive, every creeping, crawling thing recognizes the Insectum Dominus as the true scepter of the swarm. Its edge, a jagged obsidian horn harvested from a forgotten Monarch, does not merely strike; it vibrates with the heartbeat of a billion drones, granting its wielder the absolute focus of a singular, hive-mind consciousness. To hold it is to cease being a solitary creature and to become the apex of an ancient, multi-limbed dynasty. When the butterfly wings upon its hilt twitch with their phantom life, the world itself begins to tremble, for the wielder no longer walks alone—they move with the weight of the endless legion, commanding the very earth to reveal its secrets through the microscopic song of the soil. He who bears this blade is no longer a mortal; they are the High Monarch, the one who stands at the center of the web, turning the crushing indifference of the insect world into a lethal, coordinated storm of chitin and sting.</p>
      <p>You have a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. Additionally, it deals an extra 3d4 poison damage on a hit.</p>
      <p class="indent"><strong><em>Carapaced Fortitude.</em></strong> While holding the sword, you gain a +2 bonus to AC and all saving throws. Additionally, you gain immunity to poison damage and the poisoned condition.</p>
      <p class="indent"><strong><em>Vibration Sense.</em></strong> While holding the sword, you gain Tremorsense out to 60 feet. The blade picks up the microscopic vibrations of the ground, allowing you to sense the location of anything touching the floor within range.</p>
      <p class="indent"><strong><em>Noxious Piercing.</em></strong> While attuned to this weapon, any poison damage you deal (from the sword, spells etc.) ignores poison resistance. Additionally, creatures with poison immunity are treated as having resistance instead, and taking half damage.</p>
      <p class="indent"><strong><em>Sovereign of the Swarm (1/Long Rest).</em></strong> You can use an action to cast the Giant Insect spell at 7th level without expending a spell slot. This version does not require your concentration.</p>
      <p class="indent"><strong><em>Monarch's Elytra (1/Short Rest).</em></strong> Your wings are made of shifting shadows and chitinous scales. You can use your bonus action to gain 60ft flying speed. Also on each of your turns, you can use your bonus action to take the Hide action, even if you are in plain sight, as the wings distort the light around you. Additionally while you're in this form, once per turn when you dive, fly or run at least 20 feet toward a creature and hit them with a melee attack, the attack deals an extra 4d6 weapon damage and the target must succeed on a DC 18 Strength save or be knocked Prone.</p>

    <description>
      <p class="flavor">Before the first monument was raised in the Glass-Heart Barrens, there was the Khalara Empire, a civilization so vast it claimed to have shackled Time itself within vaults of gold. Qadeed Al-Khalara is the final, haunting echo of that drowned age—a masterwork of palladium and sun-forged gold, crafted not as a blade, but as a divine chalice designed to catch the very grains of destiny. The weapon’s hilt is a celestial hourglass, draped in flowing purple silks and intricate golden adornments that dance in a phantom wind, while the 'blade' is a living torrent of liquid fire and crystalline sand that spills from the chalice’s lip. It is a weapon of fluid grace; with a single thought, the sands lash out like the strike of a desert viper, extending through the air as if the desert itself were reaching out to reclaim its lost territory. To wield this sword is to carry the weight of an empire that vanished in a single, silent night, commanding a shimmering mirage of heat and history that distorts the world around the bearer. As the chalice drinks the kinetic essence of battle, it fills with the stolen moments of the fallen, allowing the wielder to pour out the 'time' of their enemies as a restorative balm for their allies. It is the scepter of a forgotten sultanate, a blade of shifting reach and eternal memory, reminding all who look upon it that even the mightiest stone eventually bows to the patient, unrelenting hunger of the dunes.</p>
      <p>You have a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. Additionally, it deals an extra 1d10 force damage on a hit.</p>
      <p class="indent"><strong><em>Granular Reach.</em></strong> This weapon has the Reach property. Unlike normal Reach, this sword provides an extra 10 feet of Reach, allowing you to make melee attacks from a 15-foot range.</p>
      <p class="indent"><strong><em>Chalice of the Shifting Hour.</em></strong> As a bonus action, you can change the sword's form. It can become any type of sword you want, retaining its reach and magical bonuses regardless of its form.</p>
      <p class="indent"><strong><em>Sands of the Mirage.</em></strong> While holding the sword, ranged weapon and ranged spell attacks against you have Disadvantage, and you have advantage on Dexterity saving throws.</p>
      <p class="indent"><strong><em>Sandstorm Strikes (1/Short Rest).</em></strong> As an action, you can swing the blade in a wide arc, sending a wave of razor-sharp sand in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in the area you choose must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking 6d8 slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much on a success. Creatures that fail are also blinded until the end of your next turn as sand scours their eyes. You can use this feature once per short rest.</p>
      <p class="indent"><strong><em>Mizan Al-Dama'a (2/Long Rest).</em></strong> The chalice hilt acts as a mystical reservoir for the kinetic energy of battle, capturing the "time" of lives being diminished. Whenever you or an allied creature within 30 feet of you deals damage to a hostile creature, the sword automatically gains Sand Charges equal to the damage dealt. The sword can hold a maximum of 60 Sand Charges. These charges are gathered automatically and do not require an action. Once the sword reaches its maximum of 60 charges, you can use a Bonus Action to release the swirling sands from the chalice. You can choose up to 6 creatures (which can include yourself) within 30 feet. The 60 charges are divided equally among the chosen creatures, and they gain that amount as Temporary Hit Points. You can use this feature twice per Long Rest. Any unexpended charges are lost at dawn.</p>

  <element name="Witness" type="Magic Item" source="HailJoe Items" id="ID_HAILJOE_WITNESS">
    <description>
      <p class="flavor">The Witness does not exist in the annals of any mortal forge, for it was never hammered into shape; it was birthed in the weeping, interstitial voids where the Great Beholders dream of absolute dominance. To grip its hilt is to feel a warm, rhythmic thrumming of a heart that beats in a chaotic, alien tempo, the obsidian flesh of the blade yielding slightly to your touch like wet, fibrous muscle. It is an 'S'-shaped nightmare of twitching nerves and calcified bone, adorned with a dozen amber eyes that do not merely watch—they scrutinize the very fabric of the soul. The blade is a living conduit to the Far Realm, a psychic parasite that translates the maddening screams of the void into lethal, enervating beams of light. To the sailors of the astral seas and the delvers of the deep dark, the Witness is the ultimate taboo—a weapon that demands the visual essence of the world to sate its eternal, unblinking hunger. It does not merely strike the enemy; it unravels them, its neural tendrils weaving into their mind to harvest their deepest fears and weaknesses. Yet, the price of its gaze is absolute; those who dare to look through the eyes of the Witness eventually realize that the blade is looking back, waiting for the moment the wielder’s own sight fails so that it may claim its final, ocular tithe.</p>
      <p>You have a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. Additionally, it deals an extra 2d8 psychic damage on a hit.</p>
      <p class="indent"><strong><em>Otherworldly Mind Barrier.</em></strong> You gain Resistance to Psychic and Force damage. Additionally, you have advantage on saving throws against being Frightened.</p>
      <p class="indent"><strong><em>The Unblinking Gaze.</em></strong> While holding the sword, you have Truesight out to 60 feet. Additionally, you cannot be surprised, and unseen attackers do not have advantage on attack rolls against you.</p>
      <p class="indent"><strong><em>Neural Bind.</em></strong> When you hit a creature, you can choose to learn one of the target's resistances, vulnerabilities, its highest/lowest stats, or saving throws with no action required.</p>
      <p class="indent"><strong><em>Synaptic Lash.</em></strong> As a bonus action, you can command this crooked blade to coil around a creature within 10 feet. The target must succeed on a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw or be Grappled. While grappled, the target has Disadvantage on Wisdom and Intelligence saving throws as the blade whispers maddening secrets directly into its mind.</p>
      <p class="indent"><strong><em>Eye Ray Resonance.</em></strong> Drawing from the latent power of its beholder-like nature, you can use one of your attacks to cause one of the eyes on the blade to fire a beam from 60 feet range. Roll a d6 to determine the ray:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>1. Paralysis Ray:</strong> The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or becomes paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</li>
        <li><strong>2. Fear Ray:</strong> The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or takes 4d8 psychic damage and becomes frightened for 1 minute. On a success, the target takes half damage. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</li>
        <li><strong>3. Slowing Ray:</strong> The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw or takes 4d8 necrotic damage. On a success, the target takes half damage. On a failed save, the target's speed is halved for 1 minute. In addition, the creature can't take reactions, and it can take either an action or a bonus action on its turn, not both. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</li>
        <li><strong>4. Enervation Ray:</strong> The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw or takes 4d8 poison damage. On a success, the target takes half damage. On a failed save, tha target becomes poisoned. While poisoned in this manner, the targeted creature can't regain Hit Points until the end of your next turn.</li>
        <li><strong>5. Telekinetic Ray:</strong> If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 18 Strength saving throw or you can move up to 30 feet in any direction. The target is restrained by the ray's telekinetic grip until the start of your next turn or until you become incapacitated. If the target is an object weighing 300 pounds or less that isn't being worn or carried, it is moved up to 30 feet in any direction. You can also exert fine control on objects with this ray, such as manipulating a simple tool or opening a door or a container.</li>
        <li><strong>6. Disintegration Ray:</strong> If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw or take 10d8 force damage. If this damage reduces the creature to 0 hit points, its body becomes a pile of fine gray dust. If the target is a Large or smaller non magical object or creation of magical force, it is disintegrated without a saving throw. If the target is a Huge or larger object or creation of magical force, this ray disintegrates a 10-foot cube of it.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="indent"><strong><em>Curse of the Ocular Tithe.</em></strong> This sword is cursed. Becoming attuned to it extends the curse to you. As long as you remain cursed, the sword demands things from you. Every 24 hours, "Witness" must consume the fresh eyes of at least one Medium or larger creature. If the blade is not fed, the wielder’s current and maximum hit points are reduced by 1d12 at the next dawn. This reduction to maximum hit points cannot be restored by any means until the blade is fed. When the blade finally consumes an eye, only the maximum hit points lost from the most recent day of starvation are restored. (e.g., if you haven't fed it for 3 days, feeding it restores only the 3rd day's loss, leaving the first two days' reduction waiting to be lifted in same manner until the curse is lifted). Every day the blade goes unfed, the wielder gains one Gestalt Stack (Maximum 10). If the wielder dies while under this curse, their body bursts open, and an Aberration sheds the flesh and is born from the remains. The Challenge Rating (CR) of this creature is equal to the Wielder’s Level + the number of Gestalt Stacks.</p>
	  <p class="indent">This curse is woven into the very soul of the wielder and cannot be ended by remove curse or wish spells. Even if the attunement ends, the curse still remains. To remove this curse, the wielder must offer the blade the eye of a nearly immortal being (such as an ancient beholder, an empyrean, or a kraken) as well as their own eyes. Consuming souls of such magnitude—both creature and wielder—sates the blade's hunger enough to lift the curse from the wielder. Once the curse is lifted, the wielder's attunement to the item is immediately broken, and the sword rejects its former master forever. The individual can never attune to this item again. Additionally, there is no means by which the sacrificed eyes can be restored. Even a wish spell cannot reverse this sacrifice or restore the wielder's sight.</p>

    <description>
      <p class="flavor">Luminosity is a violent, tangible rupture in the tapestry of the dark—a captured supernova bound by the iron will of the High Inquisition. It possesses no hilt for a mortal hand to grasp, for it is a raw pillar of celestial radiance that accepts only the touch of the 'righteous,' while its orbiting shroud of glass shards—remnants of a primordial mirror—refracts its blinding glory into a jagged, prismatic halo. The High Court presents this blade as the ultimate badge of purification, yet beneath its warm, divine thrumming lies a silent, predatory intelligence. For the 'Radiant One' is not the benevolent deity the prayers describe, but a Celestial entity of the Far Realm that feeds upon the absolute certainty of the fanatic. Each swing of the light does not just sever flesh; it harvests the wielder’s very identity, replacing precious memories of home and kin with the cold, crystalline geometry of a sun-bleached abyss. To carry Luminosity is to become a living lantern for a god that despises shadows, unaware that as you burn through the world’s darkness, the light is slowly hollowed out your soul, preparing your vessel for a cosmic arrival that will leave nothing of the original man behind but a radiant, mindless shell.</p>
      <p>You have a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. Additionally, it deals 3d4 radiant damage.</p>
      <p class="indent"><strong><em>Intangible Blade.</em></strong> Instead of dealing slashing or piercing, this sword deals radiant damage as weapon daamge. Additionally, your attacks with this weapon are made with Advantage against any target wearing metal armor or being metal itself.</p>
      <p class="indent"><strong><em>Shattered Refraction.</em></strong> The floating glass shards around the light core act as defensive prisms. While holding Luminosity, you gain a +2 bonus to AC, and you have Resistance to Radiant and Fire damage.</p>
      <p class="indent"><strong><em>Essence of the Light.</em></strong> While you are attuned to Luminosity, you do not need to eat, drink, or breathe, as your body sustains itself through the ambient light of the blade. However, you cast a 15-foot radius of Bright Light and an additional 15 feet of Dim Light at all times. This light cannot be suppressed, making it impossible for you to benefit from being Invisible or to hide in shadows.</p>
      <p class="indent"><strong><em>Prismatic Flare (3/Short Rest).</em></strong> When you are hit by a melee attack, you can use your reaction to cause the glass shards to pulse violently. The attacker must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or be Blinded until the start of your next turn. You can use this feature thrice per short rest.</p>
      <p class="indent"><strong><em>Supernova Strike (Proficiency Bonus/Long Rest).</em></strong> When you hit a creature, you can expend 1 charge to cause the light to explode at the point of impact. The target and every hostile creature within 20 feet of it must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, they take 4d8 radiant damage and are pushed 15 feet away. On a success, they take half as much damage and aren't pushed. You can use this feature equal to your proficiency bonus times per long rest.</p>
      <p class="indent"><strong><em>Eternal Dawn (1/Long Rest).</em></strong> You can use an action to drive the "blade" into the sky. The sword vanishes and becomes a miniature sun 60 feet above you for 1 minute. The area in a 120-foot radius becomes Bright Light, and any magical darkness in the area is dispelled. Any Undead, Fiend or Aberration that starts its turn in this light takes 3d6 radiant damage. You can use a bonus action to call the sword back to your hand, ending the effect early. You can use this feature once per long rest.</p>
      <p class="indent"><strong><em>Curse of the False Light.</em></strong> This sword is cursed. Becoming attuned to it extends the curse to you. As long as you remain cursed, the sword slowly corrupts you. This blade is not a gift from a benevolent deity, it is a gift from an entity that feeds on the certainty of the righteous. The corruption is subtle, manifesting as an ever-increasing obsession with "purification". The sword records your life through its shards. Every time you kill a creature, one of your personal memories is replaced by a vision of this deity's realm. When you lose certain amount of memories that you DM decides it is enough, your personality is wiped, and you become a mindless shell, an Avatar for the entity. When you become an Avatar, you can't resume to play your character. Your character becomes a Villian NPC in DM's control. The transformation of your character into an Avatar is not observable by outside eyes; even those who love your character cannot perceive this transformation from the outside.</p>
	  <p class="indent">This curse is woven into the very soul of the wielder and cannot be ended by Remove Curse or Wish spells. Even if the attunement ends, the curse still remains. To remove this curse; unlike other magical burdens, the bond between the wielder and Luminosity is absolute. It is not a magical effect that can be dispelled; it is a spiritual infection. There is no ritual, no potion, and no Wish spell capable of severing this link. The only way to break the curse and restore the wielder's soul is the complete and permanent destruction of the deity that mades and gives this sword to humanity. Until this entity is slain, the wielder remains a ticking vessel for its cosmic arrival.</p>

  <element name="Apex Grudge Tearer" type="Magic Item" source="HailJoe Items" id="ID_HAILJOE_ITEM_APEX_GRUDGE_TEARER">
    <description>
      <p class="flavor">Born from the forbidden kilns of the taboo Osteomancers, the Apex Grudge Tearer is not a product of smithing, but a grotesque collage of extinction woven together to serve the Inquisition’s Jaeger Corps. It is a jagged, meat-cleaver-like monstrosity of fused hydra teeth, black dragon scales, and the calcified marrow of krakens, all bound by the sinews of nightmare. The blade’s edge is a serrated nightmare that does not slice so much as it grinds and hooks into the soul, while its hilt—wrapped in the coarse hide of monstrosities and adorned with the feral feathers of sky-beasts—terminates in a wicked obsidian spike designed for the most intimate of executions. To the Jeagers who hunt the aberrant filth under the shadow of the Eldritch Moon, this weapon is a necessary evil; its very existence is a defiant scream against the void. Yet, the blade harbors a primal, uncontrollable spite that pulses in rhythm with the lunar cycles. It whispers of a red, endless hunger, threatening to bridge the gap between hunter and beast until the wielder's eyes cloud with a murderous frenzy. To hold the Tearer is to enter a pact with the dead; it repairs its own shattered bone with the skeletons of your victims, all while waiting for the single moment your grip falters—so it may finally taste the warm, familiar blood of its own master.</p>
      <p>You have a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls. Additionally, it deals additional 1d6 slashing damage.</p>
      <p class="indent"><strong><em>Rending Stacks.</em></strong> The jagged edge of the blade creates deepening wounds. Every time you hit the same target with this weapon, the extra slashing damage increases by 1d6, up to a 4d6 slashing damage. With innate 1d6 damage, the additional maximum damage can be 5d6 slashing damage. This stack resets if you attack a different target or when you won't hit anything in your turn.</p>
      <p class="indent"><strong><em>Obsidian Pommel.</em></strong> The sharpened obsidian piece at the base of the hilt allows you to make a melee weapon attack as a bonus action, 1d4 plus your attacking ability modifier piercing damage. If this hits, the target must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution save or take 2d6 piercing damage and bleeds at the start of its next turn.</p>
      <p class="indent"><strong><em>Apex Predator.</em></strong> You gain Resistance to Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing damage. Additionally, while you don't have all of your hit points, you can't have disadvantage in your attacks by any manners.</p>
      <p class="indent"><strong><em>Flesh-Hook Push.</em></strong> When you hit a same one size bigger creature than you or smaller, you can use a bonus action to attempt to push the target. The target must succeed on a DC 18 Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 10 feet to a direction you choose and knocked Prone.</p>
      <p class="indent"><strong><em>Osteomantic Mend.</em></strong> When you reduce a creature to 0 hit points, the sword’s bone structure "eats" a portion of the victim's skeleton to repair itself. You gain Temporary Hit Points equal to the twice of the creatures CR killed (minimum 4). This Temporary Hit Points can be stacked up to 40 in total.</p>
      <p class="indent"><strong><em>Curse of the Blood Frenzy.</em></strong> The blood and monstrosity leather used in the hilt pulse with a primal, uncontrollable rage. Whenever you deal damage with the Rending Stacks feature at its maximum, you must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, you enter a Berserk State for 1 minute. While you're in Berserk State, you must use your action each round to attack the nearest creature (friend or foe). While you're in this form, you cannot cast spells or concentrate on them nor you can use abilities like rage. You can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of your turns to end the state early. Also, the jagged nature of the blade is dangerous to the wielder. Whether you hit with advantage or not, whenever you roll a 1 on one of your attack rolls, the blade hooks into your own flesh, dealing 2d8 slashing damage to you that cannot be reduced. You can't change this dice by any manners, such abilities like portent, or feats like lucky, or mechanics like inspiration does not work for this rolled dice. This curse is woven into the very soul of the wielder and cannot be ended by Remove Curse or Wish spells. Even if the attunement ends, the curse still remains. To remove this curse, the wielder must be submerged in a pool of liquid silver for 24 hours while a high-level Cleric casts Calm Emotions every hour. This "plates" the bone in silver, suppressing the rage.</p>

    <description>
      <p class="flavor">Forged from a sliver of the Ethereal Plane and tempered in the frozen tears of a monarch who ruled over nothing but silence, Phantasma Aeterna is a weapon of haunting elegance. Long before the Escar Forest swallowed the sun-drenched marble of his palace, the Forsaken King stood upon his battlements, watching the veil between worlds thin as his beloved queen was dragged into the ghost-tide. He spent centuries trying to pierce that veil with this very needle, but found only a cold, astral hunger that eventually consumed his kingdom, leaving behind nothing but the overgrown ruins hidden deep within the Escar wilds. The sword’s metal is unnervingly light, polished to a mirror finish that reflects only the dead, while the skull upon its hilt watches the living with judging, azure eyes. Swirling plumes of ghostly plasma dance along its needle-like length—not as a decoration, but as a restless procession of the King’s fallen court, forever denied the peace of the grave. To wield this blade is to become the Sovereign of the Mourning; it grants the power to slip through the seams of reality and command the spectral legions, but it demands a terrible price: the steady, cold erasure of every warm memory of love, until the wielder is as hollow and eternal as the blade itself.</p>
      <p>You have a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. Additionally, it deals an extra 2d6 necrotic damage on a hit.</p>
      <p class="indent"><strong><em>Ethereal Jaunt (3/Short Rest).</em></strong> As a bonus action, you can become semi-incorporeal until the start of your next turn. During this time, you have Resistance to all types of damage except psychic damage and can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. If you end your turn inside an object, you take 1d10 force damage and are shunted to the nearest unoccupied space. You can use this feature thrice per short rest.</p>
      <p class="indent"><strong><em>Chilling Gaze of the Grave.</em></strong> When you hit a creature with this weapon, the target must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, it becomes Frightened of you until the end of its next turn. While frightened this way, the creature's speed is reduced to 0 because of seeing ghostly visions. Additionally, frightened creatures perceives you as an unholy undead matriarch or patriarch—a sovereign of the eterniyu who has defied the cycle of life and death. The sheer wrongness of your existence fills their mind, making them believe that your presence is a crime against nature that cannot be undone. Your voice sounds like a thousand weeping whispers to the target, and your shadow seems to grow and twist into a skeletal throne.</p>
      <p class="indent"><strong><em>Soul Siphoning (1/Short Rest).</em></strong> As a part of you attack action, you can make a special melee weapon attack with the needle-like blade. On a hit, the target takes the sword's normal damage plus an additional 4d10 necrotic damage. You regain hit points equal to half of the total damage dealt. If this attack reduces a creature to 0 hit points, its soul is momentarily trapped in the blade, granting you Advantage on death saving throws until you success three death saves. While a soul trapped in you blade with this manner, after successing 3 death saves or after stabilized, you wake up and rise with an incorporal movement and you gain hit points equal to your total level plus your proficiency bonus plus your constitution modifier. a You can use this feature once per short rest</p>
      <p class="indent"><strong><em>Sovereign of the Mourning (1/Long Rest).</em></strong> As an action, you can raise the sword to the sky. 8 Specters emerge from the blade’s plasma and appear in unoccupied spaces within 30 feet. They are friendly to you and your companions, and they obey your verbal commands. They remain for 1 minute, until they drop to 0 hit points, or until you dismiss them. This feature does not require Concentration. While your Specters are active, you can also use a Bonus Action to reach out and mentally consume one of them. The chosen Specter vanishes, and you instantly regain 5d8 hit points. This consumption can be performed only once per activation of the Sovereign of the Mourning feature. You can use this feature once per long rest.</p>
      <p class="indent"><strong><em>The Curse: The Eternal Solitude.</em></strong> This sword is cursed. Becoming attuned to it extends the curse to you. As long as you remain cursed, the blade is a vacuum for life and connection and it demands that its master belong only to the world of the dead. Your shadow no longer mimics your own movements. Instead, it takes the shape of deceased loved ones or fallen comrades. These shadows constantly point accusing fingers and whisper "Why do you still breathe?" during the night. Every Long Rest, the wielder must succeed on a DC 15 Madness Saving Throw (Wisdom Saving throw addition to including Intelligence modifier) or suffer a level of Long-Term Madness from the psychological torment.</p>
	  <p class="indent">This curse is woven into the very soul of the wielder and cannot be ended by Remove Curse or Wish spells. Even if the attunement ends, the curse still remains. To remove this curse, you cannot simply pray or offer blood; you must physically enter the border between life and death to settle their "survivor's guilt." First, you must find a place where the veil is thin (a desecrated cathedral or a battlefield where thousands died) at midnight. You must use the blade to cut your own shadow away from their feet—a process that deals 10d10 necrotic damage and reduces your maximum hit points by the same amount until the ritual is finished. Once your shadow is severed, the "Fallen Comrades" manifest as 8 Greater Shadows (statistically similar to Wraiths but with the faces of the loved ones). These entities do not attack with claws; they attack with Visions of Regret. You must survive certain amount rounds of combat of your DM's determined, and face yourself against these entities alone. However, in order to permanently banish them and lift the curse, you must perform the "Severance of Memory"; For each shadow they wish to banish, you must choose one positive memory of that person and "give the memory" to the blade. Once the memory is given to the blade, it is gone forever. You will remember the person existed and that they died, but they will never again be able to recall the sound of their laugh, the warmth of their smile, or any feeling of love they once shared. The person becomes a cold, clinical fact in their mind. If you give up all these precious memories, the shadows are sucked into the skull hilt of the blade, turning its azure eyes into a permanent, silent white. The curse is lifted, the maximum hit point reduction is restored, but the wielder is left emotionally hollow—truly alone, as the blade intended...</p>

    <description>
      <p class="flavor">Long before the records of men, in the soaring Storm Giant Citadels that drift above the highest peaks, the High Runesmiths struck a deal with the sky itself. They did not use steel or iron, but harvested a condensed cyclone from the heart of a primordial hurricane, binding it into the shape of a blade with runes of pure willpower. Tempest Calamity is the physical manifestation of that ancient pact—a weapon that thunders with the weight of a thousand storms and smells of ozone and impending judgment. It is a sword destined for the 'Herald of the High Heavens,' and its history is irrevocably bound to the Prophecy of the Eternal Dawn. According to the seers, as light rains upon the City of the Dead and the 'Two Thirteen' years draw to a close, this blade will be the only force capable of meeting the Storm Dragon’s ascent. When drawn, the clouds above boil in ancestral recognition, for the blade does not merely serve its master—it prepares the world for the clash of titans foretold in the stars. To wield it is to hold the eye of the hurricane in your palm, becoming the lightning that strikes before the final thunder of the dragon’s return.</p>
      <p>You have a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. Additionally, it deals an extra 1d6 lightning damage and 1d6 thunder damage on a hit.</p>
      <p class="indent"><strong><em>Master of Winds.</em></strong> While attuned to this weapon, you are immune to the Deafened condition and have Resistance to Lightning and Thunder damage. You have a flying speed equal to your walking speed and can hover while flying.</p>

      <p class="indent"><strong><em>Chain Lightning Strike (3/Long Rest).</em></strong> When you hit a creature with this weapon, you can cause a bolt of lightning to arc from the target to up to three other creatures of your choice within 30 feet of it. Each secondary target must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking 6d8 lightning damage on a failure, or half as much on a success. You can use this feature thrice per long rest.</p>
      <p class="indent"><strong><em>Static Discharge (1/Short Rest).</em></strong> As a bonus action, you overcharge your body with electrical energy for 1 minute. Any creature that hits you within 120 feet of you during this time takes 2d8 lightning, thunder or force damage of your choice, and it must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, creature cannot take reactions until the start of its next turn.</p>
      <p class="indent"><strong><em>Eye of the Tempest (1/Long Rest).</em></strong> You can use an action to release the storm within the blade. For 1 minute, a 30-foot-radius aura of heavy rain and howling winds surrounds you. All ranged weapon attacks entering or leaving the aura have Disadvantage, the area becomes Difficult Terrain for hostile creatures and at the start of each of your turns, any hostile creature in the aura takes 2d10 thunder damage. You can use this feature once per long rest.</p>

	  <div class="sidebar">
	    <p class="flavor">To hold Judgment’s Ember is to carry a shard of a dying star that has been taught the meaning of justice. Forged by the elite smiths of the Jaeger Corps, these blades were never intended to be singular relics, but a burning standard carried by those brave enough to look the Scourge in its many eyes. Among all who bore the flame, none were more legendary than Gideon Harrow, a bastion of the Jaeger whose sword was the first light seen in the darkest pits of the rot. Yet, the tragedy of the Scourge Hunt spares no one; Gideon fell not to the tooth or claw of the beast, but to the slow, insidious corruption that turned his righteous fire into an aberrant, everflaming nightmare. As a Fallen Hunter, Gideon became a scorched ghost of his former self—an eldritch horror of eternal ash that turned this holy implement against his own kin, hunting the hunters with a twisted, sacrificial zeal. For years, the ember burned with a corrupted, fratricidal heat until the path of the Fallen Hunter crossed with five destined souls: Orv Bezmedan, Zephyr, Luwanna, Stephen, and Rin. In a battle that shook the foundations of the Burning North Forest, the heroes did what the Jaeger could not—they quenched the blade’s madness in Gideon’s own tortured blood, granting the old warrior a final, cooling peace and reclaiming the ember to once again serve as the ultimate, searing answer to the darkness.</p>

      <p class="indent"><strong><em>Searing Bane.</em></strong> This weapon deals an additional 1d10 fire or radiant damage to Aberrations and Fiends.</p>
      <p class="indent"><strong><em>Jaeger’s Intuition.</em></strong> While attuned to this blade, you have Advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to track Aberrations and Intelligence (Nature) checks to identify their weaknesses.

      <p class="indent"><strong><em>Mantle of the Purifying Flame.</em></strong> The intense heat of the blade protects its wielder. While attuned to this sword, you have Resistance to Fire and Radiant damage. Additionally, you are Immune to the effects of extreme heat and are not affected by high-temperature environments.</p>
      <p class="indent"><strong><em>Scourge-Fire Mastery.</em></strong> The fire produced by this blade is forged from pure righteous will, making it nearly impossible to resist.

Creatures that Immune to fire damage are treated as having resistance instead.</p>
      <p class="indent"><strong><em>Ashen Leap (1/Long Rest).</em></strong> As an action, you transform into a swirling pillar of ash and flame, soaring into the air and crashing down at a point you can see within 60 feet. Upon impact, each creature of your choice within 20 feet of that point must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 6d8 fire damage and is knocked Prone. On a success, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't knocked prone. You can use this feature once per long rest.</p>
      <p class="indent"><strong><em>The Burning Decree (Proficiency Bonus/Long Rest).</em></strong> As a bonus action, you can stoke the blade's flames to judge your foes. Until the start of your next turn, the weapon deals an extra 1d8 fire or radiant damage of your choice. Any creature hit by an attack while this feature is active has its speed reduced by 10 feet until the end of its next turn. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Proficiency Bonus per Long Rest.</p>
