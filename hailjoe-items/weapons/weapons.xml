  <element name="Fang of the Dhampir" type="Magic Item" source="HailJoe Items" id="ID_HAILJOE_FANG_OF_THE_DHAMPIR">
    <description>
      <p>This item appears to be a simple wooden stake with a carved silver tip. Upon closer inspection, the silver tip is actually a sharp fang, which appears to have been taken from a vampire or dhampir. The wooden stake is infused with magical energy that allows it to draw strength from the blood of the user's enemies.</p>
      <p>Effect: When the Fang of the Dhampir is used as a melee weapon, it grants the following benefits to a monk:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The user gains temporary hit points equal to their Wisdom modifier whenever they score a critical hit against a creature with blood flowing through their veins (excluding constructs and undead).</li>
        <li>The user can spend 1 ki point as a bonus action to gain advantage on their next attack roll with the Fang of the Dhampir against a creature with blood flowing through their veins (excluding constructs and undead).</li>
        <li>Once per day, the user can choose to infuse the Fang of the Dhampir with their own blood. Doing so grants the following additional benefits until the next dawn:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>The user gains resistance to necrotic damage.</li>
          <li>The user gains advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell.</li>
          <li>The user's unarmed strikes and attacks with the Fang of the Dhampir deal an additional 1d4 necrotic damage to creatures with blood flowing through their veins (excluding constructs and undead).</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>

  <element name="Sanguinary Bloodreaper" type="Magic Item" source="HailJoe Items" id="ID_HAILJOE_SANGUINARY_BLOODREAPER">
    <description>
      <p>The Bloodreaper is a longsword made of dark obsidian, almost vantablack in color. The blade is slightly curved and glimmers with a faint crimson sheen. The handle is wrapped in black leather, and the pommel is adorned with a red gemstone that seems to pulse with energy. The sword seems to sing a haunting melody when wielded in battle.</p>
      <p>Effect: When a hexblade warlock wields the Bloodreaper, they gain the following benefits:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The sword is a +3 magic weapon made of obsidian.</li>
        <li>Whenever the user lands a successful hit with the sword, they regain 1d8 + Constitution modifier hit points.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="indent"><i><b>Blood Bond:</b></i> The sword has a special ability called Blood Bond. Whenever the user successfully hits a creature with the sword, they form a blood bond with that creature. While the bond is active, the user can use their bonus action to make a melee spell attack against the creature, dealing an additional 2d6 necrotic damage. The bond lasts for 24 hours or until the creature dies. If the user becomes unconscious, the bond vanishes immediately. This bonus action melee spell attack does not count as a "successful hit with the sword," so the user can't regain hit points by using the bonus attack.</p>
      <p class="indent"><i><b>Sanguine Strike:</b></i> The sword also has an ability called Sanguine Strike. Once per short or long rest, the user can teleport up to 15 feet forward and stab the sword into the ground. After the jump, all creatures within a 15-foot radius centered on the user are pushed 5 feet away from the center point, and all creatures in this area must make a Dexterity saving throw with a DC equal to 8 + the user's proficiency bonus + the user's Charisma modifier. On a failed saving throw, they take 6d6 necrotic damage, or half as much damage on a successful one. Creatures who succeed on the saving throw are not pushed away.</p>
      <p class="indent"><i><b>Bloodletting:</b></i> The sword has a passive ability called Bloodletting. Whenever the user is struck by a melee attack, they can use their reaction to make a melee attack against the attacker with the Bloodreaper. If the attack hits, the attacker takes an extra 1d6 necrotic damage, and the user regains hit points equal to the damage dealt. The user can only use this reaction when bonded with the "Blood Bond" ability; otherwise, the user can't use this reaction.</p>

  <element name="Infernal Baneblade" type="Magic Item" source="HailJoe Items" id="ID_HAILJOE_INFERNAL_BANEBLADE">
    <description>
      <p>The Infernal Baneblade is a finely crafted longsword forged from the darkest of metals and adorned with intricate, ominous engravings. Its hilt is wrapped in deep crimson leather, and a sinister ruby gemstone is embedded in the pommel. The blade itself seems to flicker with an internal flame, casting eerie shadows even in the brightest light.</p>
      <p>class="indent"><i><b>Effect:</b></i> When the user attunes to the Infernal Baneblade, they gain the following benefits:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>As a melee weapon, Infernal Baneblade functions as a +2 magic longsword</li>
        <li>Infernal Baneblade is a Sentient Weapon with unknown stats. It can communicate telepathically with its wielder. It has hearing and Devil's Sight to 120 ft and he can see through the magical darkness.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>All Effects:</p>
      <p class="indent"><i><b>Infernal Fury:</b></i> The sword deals an additional 2d6 fire damage on every successful hit, against fiends. This fire damage is considered magical and bypasses any fire resistance or immunity possessed by demons.</p>
      <p class="indent"><i><b>Demonbane Enchantment:</b></i> The Infernal Baneblade has been imbued with the essence of demonic creatures during its creation. As a result, it grants its wielder advantage on all attack rolls against demons.</p>
      <p class="indent"><i><b>Demonic Resonance:</b></i> When attuned to the Infernal Baneblade, the wielder gains resistance to fire damage, taking half damage from all fire-based attacks and effects.</p>
      <p class="indent"><i><b>Hellfire Strike:</b></i> Once per long rest, the wielder can channel the sword's demonic energy to deliver a devastating Hellfire Strike. This strike envelops the blade in raging flames and allows the wielder to make a single melee attack with advantage. If the attack hits, it deals an additional 4d6 fire damage, and the target must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or be set ablaze, taking an additional 2d6 fire damage at the start of each of its turns until it takes an action to extinguish the flames.</p>
      <p class="indent"><strong><em>Curse of the Blood Hunger.</em></strong> This insidious curse, steeped in dark and ancient magic, ignites an unquenchable thirst within its unfortunate victim. From the moment it takes hold, an insatiable craving for the life essence of others consumes them. The cursed individual is driven to seek out fresh blood, be it from mortal veins or the pulsing hearts of creatures. As time goes on, the hunger grows more ravenous, slowly eroding their humanity and instilling a relentless predator's instinct. The curse distorts their thoughts, warping their once noble intentions into a primal obsession for sating their unending bloodlust. The cursed one is forever tormented by the dichotomy of their desires—a desperate longing for release from the curse's grip, while simultaneously reveling in the euphoria that accompanies the taste of warm, crimson life.</p>
      <p class="indent">When the Infernal Baneblade is equipped and attuned, with each kill that has taken by this swors wearer, "Infernal Baneblade" absorbs the blood. The user rolls for DC 16 Constitution saving throw. On failing save, causing the crystals to glow on the item, and increase the wearer's attack and damage bonus by +1 but reducing his max HP by -5, up to a 5 stacks, resetting each day. The user may willingly choose to fail this save.</p>
      <p class="indent">After a threshold of 5 is reached in one day, the sword would curse and bind itself to the wearer, making its effects permanent, but requiring a blood tax - either in the form of necrotic damage to the wearer, or forcing the character to kill a given number of creatures in required blood amount for every day. Each day, the wearer should kill at least 3 kills.</p>
      <p class="indent">For each day that user neglects the dark urge, the wearer has to make an DC 19 Constitution saving throw and take 2d6 necrotic damage or half as much in a success. Whether success or fails, the user also lose his/her max hit points equal amount to the damage recieves. The only way to gain lost hit points in this way, is feeding the relentless blood urge. The user has to feed the item with blood in sufficient amount which is 3 medium sized humanoid creatures blood. This sufficient amount stacks when the user doesn't feeds the item.</p>
      <p class="indent">If the item drains the wearers hit points to zero, it will consume their body and the sword becomes alive, a Chaotic Evil creature with equal amount the CR to the characters level or monster CR it just killed. It would echo the wearer's voice, but it would be a demonic entity that the ultimate demonic entities wishes. When the appeared demonic entity killed, the sword itself would return to being just as a sword, waiting to be used for its next victim.</p>
      <p class="indent">The person who died in this manner, can't return back from the death. Upon with his/her death, the users soul merges with the Evil creature, and when the user tried to turn back to life, Evil creature will return back instead of him/her. The users will and soul, shatters in the dark existance and will no longer be able to return...</p>
      <p class="indent">This item is impervious to magical effects and damage, even without the exception of a remove curse spell, which would normally detach the seal from its wearer and unattune from them automatically. But for this uncontrollable hunger, there is no solution except dying. Even after the dying, the users soul will be long gone. Only "Wish" spell could find a cure with an uncertain and unclear manner.</p>

      <p>When you attune to this weapon, you will learn light cantrip. If you cast the light cantrip targeting this weapon, the carved runes activate. For the duration of the spell, as long as you hold the weapon, your Wisdom score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, and you can see normally in darkness, both magical and nonmagical, to a distance of 60 feet.</p>

      <p class="indent"><i><b>Trick Weapon:</b></i> The Faux Lunaire is a wickedly curved scythe crafted from an arcane alloy and engraved with lunar imagery and celestial runes. With a swift, spinning motion, the limbs of the blade and shaft of the scythe fold in and rotate around the grip, locking into place to form an ornate shortbow. As a bonus action, you can switch between the transformed and untransformed states of this weapon. As part of the bonus action, you can also magically teleport up to 10 feet to an unoccupied space that you can see. In its untransformed state, this weapon is a scythe. In its transformed state, it’s a shortbow.</p>
      <p class="indent"><i><b>Untransformed:</b></i> Once on each of your turns when you damage a creature with this weapon, you can force it to make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, becoming affected by the faerie fire spell on a failure. You do not need to concentrate on this spell, but it ends early if you put another creature under the effect of the spell, or if you fall unconscious.</p>
      <p class="indent"><i><b>Transformed:</b></i> In its transformed state, the Faux Lunaire has 2 charges. When you attack a creature with this bow, you can expend 1 charge to cast one of the following spells (save DC 17) from it (no action required): moonbeam or darkness. The spell is centered on the creature’s space and lasts until the end of your next turn. You do not need to concentrate on it, and you can only have one of these spells active at a time. If your attack misses, you expend the charge but the effect fails. The Faux Lunaire regains 1 expended charge each time it is targeted by the light cantrip.</p>

      <p class="flavor">This weapon bears the final echo of a tyrant’s restraint — wield it wisely, lest the land break under your hand.</p>
      <p>This massive hammer crackles with residual heat and pressure. Forged from obsidian and rune-bound steel, its head glows faintly with dormant volcanic rune sigils.</p>
      <p>When you attuned to this weapon, you considered as proficient on Mauls. Additionally your Strength score is 19 while you wear these gauntlets. They have no effect on you if your Strength is already 19 or higher without them.</p>
      <p>You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. This bonus does not consist on magical attacks. Also you can use this weapon as an arcane focus.</p>
      <p class="indent"><i><b>Sigil Warrior:</b></i> Whenever you hit a creature with this weapon, you can choose to erupt a rune. This maul has 5 rune sigils. When you erupt a rune, choose a target. The target must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or take an additional 1d6 fire damage and be pushed 5 feet away from you.</p>
      <p class="indent"><i><b>Valkørr’s Fury:</b></i> Once per long rest, as an action, you can slam the hammer into the ground, causing a volcanic tremor. All creatures within 40 ft long 20 ft wide line must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 3d6 fire and 3d6 bludgeoning damage.</p>
