        <description>
            <p>After consuming the heart of the defeated Lunar Lycanthropy Werewolf Alpha, "The All Devourer" undergoes a transformative experience, gaining a potent mutational power-up with both benefits and drawbacks.</p>
            <p class="indent"><i><b>Enhanced Vigor:</b></i> Your Constitution score increases by +2, maximum of 22, and you gain advantage on Constitution saving throws.</p>
            <p class="indent"><i><b>Necrotic Resilience:</b></i> You gain resistance to necrotic damage, and you can use your reaction to absorb necrotic energy, healing for half the damage you would have taken.</p>
            <p class="indent"><i><b>Uncontrollable Transformation:</b></i> During periods of a full moon or when exposed to intense moonlight, you must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, you unwillingly transform into a werewolf for 1 hour, losing control of your actions. Your alignment temporarily shifts to chaotic evil nonetheless during these transformations.</p>
            <p class="indent"><i><b>Lunar Dependency:</b></i> You become reliant on moonlight to maintain your strength. In the absence of moonlight, you suffer a -2 penalty to all of your ability scores and deal 1d8 necrotic damage to yourself at the start of each of your turns. You can't benefit long or short rest in this situation. This effect is negated as soon as you are exposed to moonlight again.</p>

            <p>With a swift, forceful gesture, the caster releases a swirling torrent of icy flames that erupts in a spectacular display. The surge races forward, creating a path of frozen fire that burns with an intense cold. Anything caught in its wake is simultaneously scorched by the searing heat and frozen by the biting cold, making it particularly devastating to both flesh and metal. As an action, you can unleash a burst of frostfire in a 20-foot cone. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + proficiency bonus + Charisma modifier). On a failed save, a creature takes 4d8 fire damage and 4d8 cold damage and is pushed 10 feet away from you. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and is not pushed.</p>

        <description>Supernatural Gift for those who have survived the Trial of the Everwasting Sands.</description>

    <element name="Scion of the Shifting Dunes" type="Magic Item" source="HailJoe Items" id="ID_HAILJOE_GIFT_SCION_OF_THE_SHIFTING_DUNES">
        <description>
            <p class="flavor">To undergo the Trial of the Everwasting Sands is to barter one's mortality with the sun itself. Deep within the Sand Horizon Aurora Borealis's, where the horizon bleeds into a permanent, shimmering haze, lies the domain of Makber, the Shroud of Dunes. It is said that Makber does not judge by heart or deed, but by the resonance of one's soul against the unrelenting grit of the sirocco. For forty days and forty nights, the supplicant must wander without shade or water, their spirit flayed open by the heat until only the coreglass remains—the indomitable essence of the resolute. In the ancient texts of the Harmonium Archive, it is whispered that Makber was once a boon companion to the legendary polymath Al-Jazari, and it was through their shared mastery of metal and mirage that the first sands were taught to remember the shape of men. To emerge as a Scion is to be recognized as 'worthy' by the desert’s silent king; the sand no longer abrades your skin but flows around it like a lover’s touch. You become a ghost of the dunes, a warrior who can vanish into a swirl of dust only to reappear where the wind dictates, carrying within your veins the scorching, metallic legacy of Al-Jazari’s forge and the eternal, shifting protection of Makber’s shroud.</p>
            <p>You have survived the Trial of the Everwasting Sands, a rite of passage where the desert either consumes the weak or blesses the resolute. Your lungs have tasted the searing wind of sands, and your blood has harmonized with the ancient rhythm of the dunes. The desert no longer sees you as a trespasser, but as part of its ever-shifting expanse.</p>
            <p class="indent"><i><b>Sand Veil Escape:</b></i> When you take damage, you can use your Reaction to partially dissolve into a swirl of sand and sink into the ground. You halve the damage taken, and you immediately teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Proficiency Bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.</p>
            <p class="indent"><i><b>Mirage Sight:</b></i> You have Advantage on Wisdom (Perception) and Intelligence (Investigation) checks made to see through illusions or to find hidden paths or find oases in desert environments. Additionally, you are immune to the effects of extreme heat.</p>
            <p class="indent"><i><b>Winds of the Sirocco:</b></i> You know the Al-Jazari’s Metalsmith cantrip and can cast it without any material components. If you have an Extra Attack or Multiattack or similar feature, once per turn you can cast this cantrip in place of one of those attacks. Additionally, when you reach 5th level, you can cast the Blur spell once without expending a spell slot, appearing as a shimmering heat haze. You regain the ability to cast it this way when you finish a Long Rest. You can decide which Attribute will be your spellcasting ability for these spells (choose when you gain this gift).</p>
