        <description>
            <p>The Oath of Vengeance is a solemn commitment to punish those who have committed grievously evil acts. When evil armies slaughter helpless villagers, when a tyrant defies the will of the gods, when a thieves’ guild grows too violent, when a dragon rampages through the countryside—at times like these, paladins arise and swear an Oath of Vengeance to set right what has gone wrong.</p>
            <h5 class="caption">TENETS OF VENGEANCE</h5>
            <p>The tenets of the Oath of Vengeance vary by paladin, but all revolve around punishing transgressors by any means necessary. Paladins who uphold these tenets are willing to sacrifice even their own righteousness to mete out justice.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Show the wicked no mercy.</em></strong> My purity is not as important as the elimination of evil.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Fight injustice and its causes.</em></strong> Where there is a choice between fighting my sworn foes and combating lesser evils, I choose the greater evil.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Aid those harmed by injustice.</em></strong> No matter the cost, I will protect the innocent and the weak from those who would harm them.</p>
