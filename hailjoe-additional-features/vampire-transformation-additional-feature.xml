			<p><i>You can equip this item to “enable” it. It remains hidden from the inventory on your character sheet.</i></p>
			<p>Vampires are terrifying hunters and manipulators. They use their powers to shape-shift and bend other creatures' wills as they terrorize and feed on populations over generations. Vampires disguise their accursed, immortal natures, passing as mortals to feed on the blood of the living. While the youngest vampires might be little more than bloodthirsty servants of their creators, the eldest possess incredible cunning and control over supernatural forces of the night. Undead vampires lie dormant during the day, retreating to resting places hidden from foes and the sun's searing rays. Roll on or choose a result from the Vampire Resting Places table to inspire a vampire's grim sanctuary. </p>

			<p>Vampires are powerful undead with the ability to suppress their monstrous thirst and resist their darker urges. In humanoid form, they appear graceful and alluring, with a cold elegance that hints at the predator within. A vampire is often a solitary figure, haunted by the fear of what might become of those around them should their bloodlust take hold. </p>

			<p>If you drop to 0 Hit Points outside of your resting place, you gain advantage on your saving throws. After you successfully stabilize, you can also use your Shapeshift feature to become mist (no action required). While in mist form, you cannot return to your vampire form until you reach your resting place within 2 hours — otherwise, you die. Once there, you revert to your vampire form and become Paralyzed until you regain any Hit Points. You recover 1 Hit Point after spending 1 hour in your resting place.</p>

		<description>
			<p>You can bite a creature within 5 feet that is willing or that has the Grappled, Incapacitated, or Restrained condition. The creature must succeed on a DC (8 + Proficiency + Constitution Modifier) Constitution saving throw or takes 1d4 + your constitution modifier piercing damage plus 1d6 necrotic damage. The target's Hit Point maximum decreases by an amount equal to the total damage taken, and the vampire regains Hit Points equal to that amount. A Humanoid reduced to 0 Hit Points by this damage and then buried rises the following sunset as a Vampire Spawn under the vampire's control.</p>

			<p>If you aren’t in sunlight or running water, you can shapeshift into a Tiny bat (Speed 5 ft., Fly Speed 30 ft.) or a Medium cloud of mist (Speed 5 ft., Fly Speed 20 ft. [hover]), or return to your vampire form. Anything you're wearing transforms with you. While in bat form, you can't speak. Your game statistics, other than your size and Speed, remain unchanged. While in mist form, you can't take actions, speak, or manipulate objects. You are weightless and can enter another creature's space and stop there. If air can pass through a space, you can move through it as mist, but you can’t pass through liquid. You have resistance to all damage except damage taken from sunlight.</p>
